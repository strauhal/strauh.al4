    Hearing the difference now isn't the reason to encode to FLAC. FLAC uses lossless compression, while MP3 is 'lossy'. What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA - it's about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don't want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.<br>

    I started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrange…well don’t get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren’t stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you’ll be glad you did.<br><br>

    Oh you listen to classical music huh? What’s your favourite motet by Josquin Desprez then? You favor the ossia cadenza of Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3 over the toccata-like one? You think Van Cliburn's rendition is among the greatest? How would you value the emotional impact of Marie's Cradle Song in Berg's Wozzeck? did Wagner do a good job to musically convey descent into the depths of the earth at the end of the 2nd scene of Rheingold? Whose rendition of Ravel's Gaspard de la nuit do you prefer? Gieseking's 1954 recording? Argerich 1975? Or Michelangeli 1959? What resonates more with you? The Tristan or the Electra Chord? You do know both of them by heart, do you? What's your opinion on those topics then, grown man?<br><br>

    “Things have changed, Boss. We pull in money, fry cooks, just to combat hunger. Rubbing our patties in tasty palettes of herbs, all for revenue. The world calls for burgers, and we answered. No frozen food, no ranch sauce.” “Kaz...” “Hunger made them taste swell, but we’re getting even sweeter.” “I know…I’ve already been eating. Weight Watcher’s not my kind of diet anyway.” “Carbs galore, for three whole meals. That ends today. Now you’re not fasting, and we’re not junkfood hounds. We’re ballpark dogs. We can crush hunger, Boss. And you can build the eatery that can do it.” “Just one thing, Kaz. This isn’t about lowfat, we’re cooking for the flavor.”<br><br>

    I saw Ryan Gosling at a grocery store in Los Angeles a few years back. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.<br>
    He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”<br>
    I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br>
    The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>
    When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.<br><br>

    You're no artist, you suck! You're a mediocre piece of shit! You can't even play. You suck. I've been playing 41 years. You suck. You OBVIOUSLY don't have the talent. You don't have the respect for yourself or other people or what it is to respect yourself in music or any other form of creativity. You're a self-consumed, no-talent, mediocre piece of SHIT. And I've earned my right to say it. OKAY? I had 200,000 people with me in 1975. I walked Bob Dylan up on stage. Who the fuck are you? I knew The Grateful Dead from 1966! WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? You're nothing! You're nothing! You are nothing. You will never be anything. NEVER. How DARE you? How dare you? You miserable, mediocre NOTHING. Go learn to play. Go learn to play.You're FLAT. You can't even carry a fucking note. I don't care about your little, like, horn lip. It doesn't mean you that know how to play. You're FLAT.
